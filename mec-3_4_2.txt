How can we access the tweet data from twitter? Is there an API which can provide this data?
Will the data be provided periodically or is it a one time data dump?
Where can we store the data? Is it in cloud or local data bases?
If cloud, which cloud is used and what kind of tools can be used to access this data?
How fast(HW capabilities where the learning will happen) will we be able to process this data? 
WHat is the output of the tweet reactions we are looking for? Is the requirement to classify the reactions to happy, sad etc?
Are the tweets need to be analyzed only in English or other languages too?
What kind of accuracy are we looking for from the model?
WHat kind of events are we looking for analyzing the tweet reactions?
Where will the output of the model go to? Does this need to be fed to a different system?
What is the infrastructure to deploy the model to production?
Once in production, how often can we make changes to the model?
